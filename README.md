# NilMode

Minimal browser helper that blocks Facebook or YouTube entirely or hides the most distracting parts (feed, stories, recommendations, shorts, comments, next videos). Turn things off when you want to watch or read something intentional, turn them back on when you're done.

Now also includes an early experimental toggle: "Productive Facebook" which injects a small ❌ button beside each post author's name (no action yet—visual cue / hook for future post-level controls).

### Developer Note (Structure)
The monolithic `content.js` was first split, and is now further decomposed:

`content/`
	- `utils.js` – shared helpers (visibility, etc.)
	- `init.js` – orchestration (reads storage, applies features, observers)

`content/facebook/`
	- `productive.js` – inject Productive Facebook buttons
	- `blacklist.js` – blacklist hide logic
	- `sponsored.js` – sponsored post detection & hide/restore
	- `reels.js` – reels hide/restore

`content/youtube/`
	- `style.js` – stylesheet injection for playlist UI
	- `time.js` – time parsing/formatting utilities
	- `extract.js` – DOM extraction of stats (pure vs watch playlist)
	- `statsPopulate.js` – populate boxes from stored/extracted stats
	- `handlers.js` – update/delete button handlers (stats box)
	- `save.js` – save playlist + create stats box
	- `inject.js` – decide whether to show button or stats box and insert it

Manifest lists these in dependency-safe order; all functions remain global so existing calls continue working.

## Privacy
We do not send anything anywhere. The extension only remembers the switches you turn on or off. You can remove it at any time.

---

## Install
1. Download this folder to your computer (keep it somewhere you won’t delete accidentally).
2. Open Chrome and go to: chrome://extensions
3. Turn on “Developer mode” (top right).
4. Click “Load unpacked” and select the folder.
5. (Optional) Pin the extension icon so it’s easy to reach.

To remove: go back to chrome://extensions and remove it.

To update (if you change files): on the same page press the Reload button on the extension card.

## How To Use
1. Click the extension icon. A small window (popup) appears with three tabs: Facebook, YouTube, Settings.
2. For each platform, choose what to block or hide:
	- Block Facebook / Block YouTube: sends you to a simple motivational page instead of opening the site.
	- Hide Feed / Hide Stories (Facebook): removes the infinite scroll areas.
	- Productive Facebook (experimental): adds a ❌ button next to each post author (future: quick dismiss or focus tools).
	- Hide Recommendations / Shorts / Comments / Next Suggestions (YouTube): strips away the usual rabbit holes.
3. Open or refresh the site—changes apply immediately.
4. Want a temporary break from all blocking? Open the Settings tab and toggle “Pause”.
5. Set how many minutes the pause should last (defaults to 5). When time expires, blocking resumes automatically.
6. Uncheck any box to bring that section back (may need a quick refresh if the site is heavily cached).

Tip: Start with hiding only the pieces that waste your time most. You can always add more.

## What You’ll See When Blocking
If you try to open a blocked site you’ll land on a neutral page with a short message and a quote. That’s intentional—quick pattern interrupt, no drama.

---

## If Something Looks Broken
- A section you hid won’t come back: uncheck its box and refresh the page.
- Nothing happens at all: make sure the extension is still loaded (chrome://extensions) and reload the page.
- Still stuck: turn off all toggles, refresh, then re-enable only one to isolate.

This extension is intentionally minimal—no accounts, no syncing beyond your browser’s own sync feature.

## FAQ (Short)
**Does this track me?** No.

**Will updates to Facebook or YouTube break hiding?** Occasionally. If something stops hiding, just leave it unchecked until a future version.

**Can I pause it?** Yes—use the Pause toggle and choose minutes.

**Can I add other sites?** Not in this simplified version.

**Does it work in other browsers?** Should work in Chromium-based browsers that support Manifest V3.

**Was this readme generated by AI?** Obviously😒
