# NilMode

Minimal browser helper that blocks Facebook or YouTube entirely or hides the most distracting parts (feed, stories, recommendations, shorts, comments, next videos). Turn things off when you want to watch or read something intentional, turn them back on when you're done.

## Privacy (Plain English)
We do not send anything anywhere. The extension only remembers the switches you turn on or off. You can remove it at any time.

## How To Use
1. Click the extension icon. A small window (popup) appears with three tabs: Facebook, YouTube, Settings.
2. For each platform, choose what to block or hide:
	- Block Facebook / Block YouTube: sends you to a simple motivational page instead of opening the site.
	- Hide Feed / Hide Stories (Facebook): removes the infinite scroll areas.
	- Hide Recommendations / Shorts / Comments / Next Suggestions (YouTube): strips away the usual rabbit holes.
3. Open or refresh the site‚Äîchanges apply immediately.
4. Want a temporary break from all blocking? Open the Settings tab and toggle ‚ÄúPause‚Äù.
5. Set how many minutes the pause should last (defaults to 5). When time expires, blocking resumes automatically.
6. Uncheck any box to bring that section back (may need a quick refresh if the site is heavily cached).

Tip: Start with hiding only the pieces that waste your time most. You can always add more.

## What You‚Äôll See When Blocking
If you try to open a blocked site you‚Äôll land on a neutral page with a short message and a quote. That‚Äôs intentional‚Äîquick pattern interrupt, no drama.

---

## If Something Looks Broken
- A section you hid won‚Äôt come back: uncheck its box and refresh the page.
- Nothing happens at all: make sure the extension is still loaded (chrome://extensions) and reload the page.
- Still stuck: turn off all toggles, refresh, then re-enable only one to isolate.

This extension is intentionally minimal‚Äîno accounts, no syncing beyond your browser‚Äôs own sync feature.
